# Transportation Cost Optimization using Linear Programming in R

**Author:** Ritik Tickoo  
**Date:** May 2025

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies **Linear Programming (LP)** to minimise transportation costs in a retail supply chain. Using the `lpSolve` package in R, we optimised product distribution from two distribution centres to three stores, meeting all demand and capacity constraints at the lowest possible cost.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement
A retail chain wants to ship products from:
- 2 Distribution Centres (DCs)
- To 3 Stores  
While:
- Meeting store demand
- Not exceeding DC supply
- Minimising total transport costs

## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- R
- lpSolve
- GitHub (documentation)

## ðŸ§® Solution Method
We used LP with:
- 6 decision variables (x1 to x6)
- Constraints: supply limits, demand satisfaction
- Objective: minimise cost = Î£(unit_cost * units_shipped)

## âœ… Results
- Total Cost: **$13,200**
- Store A fully served from DC1
- Store B & C fully served from DC2

See `Ritik_Tickoo_LP_Project_Report.docx` for full explanation, and `transportation_lp_code.R` for implementation.
